    <p>
      As an experienced video editor, I specialize in crafting engaging and
      polished content for VTubers and content creators. With expertise in
      software like Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and DaVinci Resolve, I
      ensure each video is fine-tuned to perfection, matching the brand's style
      and audience preferences. My editing work spans promotional videos, live
      streams, and highlights, providing a dynamic viewing experience while
      meeting deadlines efficiently.
